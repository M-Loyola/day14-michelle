How to do IPM?
-------------------------------------

The team organizes the work to be completed in the upcoming iteration (also known as a sprint) during the Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM), a critical event in Agile techniques, notably in Scrum. Here is a detailed explanation of how to carry out an efficient IPM:

Preparing for the Meeting: The Product Owner must make sure that the Product Backlog is organized and prioritized correctly in order to be ready for the Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM). The Scrum Master is in charge of organizing and setting the meeting's time, taking into account the team members' schedules. The groundwork for an effective IPM session is laid in this stage.

Set the Scene: The Scrum Master outlines the meeting's goals and agenda at the start of the IPM. This assists to give the team context and establish a distinct focus on what must be accomplished throughout the session. The Scrum Master also highlights the overall objective of the upcoming iteration and the team's commitment to delivering a worthwhile increment by the end of the iteration.

Review of the Previous Iteration: Analyzing the successes and unfinished tasks from the previous iteration is an essential part of the IPM. The team can evaluate their progress during this session and identify any problems or difficulties that still need to be solved. This retrospective viewpoint offers priceless insights that guide the preparation for the following iteration.

Review of the Product Backlog: The Product Owner leads the presentation of the highest-priority items from the Product Backlog that are deemed prepared for inclusion in the following iteration during the IPM. This presentation involves thoroughly outlining user stories or tasks to make sure that everyone on the team is aware of the specifications and desired results of the future work.

Review of the Product Backlog: The Product Owner leads the presentation of the highest-priority items from the Product Backlog that are deemed prepared for inclusion in the following iteration during the IPM. This presentation involves thoroughly outlining user stories or tasks to make sure that everyone on the team is aware of the specifications and desired results of the future work.

Task Breakdown: The work of breaking down the user stories from the Product Backlog into more manageable, smaller tasks or sub-tasks is taken on by the development team. A more detailed knowledge of the work that has to be done is made possible by this breakdown. The team also calculates the time needed to complete each activity, frequently using tools like story points or ideal days, which helps with successful planning.

Capability and Commitment: Talking about the team's capability for the following iteration is a crucial component of the IPM. This conversation considers elements including the availability of individual team members, any approaching holidays, and other obligations that can affect the team's availability. The team agrees to work together to complete a portion of the Product Backlog items during the iteration based on this capacity assessment.

Task Assignment: The development team divides up the work into individual team members after having a clear grasp of what has to be done. Each team member's abilities and knowledge are taken into account in this assignment, as well as their availability throughout the iteration. In order to avoid any team member from getting overburdened, tasks are distributed evenly.

Establish Acceptance Criteria: The team creates concise acceptance criteria jointly for each job or user narrative. These requirements specify the particular requirements that must be fulfilled in order for the job to be deemed finished and prepared for review. The creation of these standards guarantees that everyone is aware of what is expected of each piece of work.

The IPM results in the construction of the iteration plan, which acts as a visual representation of the work that has to be done. Using a task board, either real or virtual, this plan is frequently realized. The team can follow progress throughout the iteration thanks to the task arrangement, which places tasks in columns with their respective statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done).

Timeboxing: The IPM keeps to a predetermined time limit, typically between one and two hours, to preserve focus and efficiency. This timeboxing technique keeps discussions brief and on topic, allowing for efficient planning within the allotted time.

The Scrum Master explains the commitments and agreements reached throughout the meeting as the IPM draws to an end. This recap aims to reaffirm the team's grasp of the strategy and the iteration's goals. It is emphasized once more how crucial continued cooperation and transparent communication are to the team's success. At this stage, any necessary follow-up conversations are also scheduled.

How to do Kick off?
-------------------------------------

A key stage in starting a new project or initiative is a kick-off meeting, which is similar to a project initiation meeting. It assists in coordinating the project's goals, scope, expectations, and preliminary planning with the Business Analyst (BA) and Quality Assurance (QA) team members. A step-by-step manual for organizing a kick-off meeting with BAs and QAs is provided below:

Decide on a Date and Send Out Invitations: Choose a time and date that work for the kick-off meeting. Invite all necessary parties, such as project managers, developers, business analysts, and members of the quality assurance team.

Define the agenda and purpose: Declare the kick-off meeting's objective, which should be to introduce the project, its goals, its scope, and its preliminary plan. To keep the meeting focused and productive, develop an agenda that lists the subjects to be discussed.

Introduction and Salutations: If you are the meeting leader, begin by extending a warm welcome to all participants and introducing yourself. Give a succinct description of the project and its significance to the company.

Project overview: Give a thorough summary of the project, emphasizing its aims, targets, and anticipated results. Describe the purpose of the project and how it will help the company accomplish its needs.

Goals and Products: Give a description of the project's scope, highlighting both its inclusions and, just as important, its exclusions. Talk about the project's deliverables and how they will affect the company's bottom line.

Responsibilities and roles: Clarify the obligations of the members of the Quality Assurance team as well as business analysts. Collaboration with other team members and discussion of how each member's position contributes to the project's success.

Project schedule and completion dates: The project schedule should be discussed, including with important dates and deadlines. Describe the project's phases or iterations in general, including the order of the tasks and deliverables.

Plan for Communication:
Explain the project's communication strategy in detail. Define the channels of communication that will be used to inform team members and stakeholders of progress updates, difficulties, and crucial decisions.

Conditions and Supporting Records: Investigate the project's needs and the method used to collect them for the business analysts. Describe how specifications will be written down, checked, and improved over time.

Strategy for Quality Assurance: Talk about the project's quality assurance strategy and approach. Describe the phases, procedures, and tools of the testing process as well as how QA will be included into the development process.

Workflow and Collaboration: Emphasize the cooperation between the QA team and the business analysts. Describe how they will collaborate to make sure that test cases are created appropriately based on requirements and that the finished result satisfies business requirements.

Clarifications and Q&A: Allow for inquiries, explanations, and discussion. Participants should feel free to ask any questions they may have about the project, their roles, or the procedures.

Conclusion and Next Steps: List the main points from the kick-off meeting. Stress the value of collaboration, open communication, and dedication to the project's success. Give a summary of the next steps, including any particular tasks or actions needed before the next meeting.

Monitoring and Record-Keeping: Send meeting notes or a summary outlining the topics covered, the conclusions reached, and the assigned actions to everyone who attended after the meeting. All parties are on the same page and have access to the information thanks to this documentation.

You may organize a kick-off meeting that successfully aligns business analysts and quality assurance team members with the project's objectives and establishes the foundation for productive collaboration throughout the project lifecycle by following these steps.

How to do Desk Check?
-------------------------------------

In a desk check, which is sometimes referred to as a desk review or walkthrough, developers, business analysts, and members of the quality assurance (QA) team all work together to review the project. Its goal is to make sure that the developers' work complies with the project specifications and upholds the expected levels of quality. Here is a detailed procedure for carrying out a desk check with developers, BAs, and QAs:

The Desk Check's timetable: Set up a time that is convenient for the development team, the BAs, and the QAs. Ensure that all necessary participants are available to contribute to the review.

Get the Work Ready: Developers should make sure their work is prepared for review prior to the desk check. This could consist of written instructions, paperwork, and other pertinent materials.

Overview and Situation: Give an overview of the work being assessed before starting the desk check. Describe the review's objective and its significance in assuring compliance with specifications and quality standards.

Presentation by the developer: The developer shows the group their work. This can entail going over the updated code, describing the added features, and displaying any user interface changes.

Examining the requirements: The BAs are essential to this stage. They make that the finished product adheres to the original requirements, user stories, and acceptance standards. For further discussion, any differences or variations are mentioned.

Standardization and Code Quality: The development team talks about coding standards compliance, coding quality, and best practices. This might entail a discussion of the readability, maintainability, and structure of the code.

QA Viewpoint: QAs evaluate the work from the perspective of testing. They examine the developer's modifications to see if they adhere to the standards for successful testing. Any potential issues or trouble spots during testing are noted.
